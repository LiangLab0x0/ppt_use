title HelixCore Multi-Agent Workflow Execution

participant "User/Researcher" as User
participant "Portal UI" as UI
participant "API Gateway" as API
participant "PlannerAgent" as Planner
participant "ExecutorAgent" as Executor
participant "CriticAgent" as Critic
participant "Temporal\nWorkflow" as Temporal
participant "Algorithm\nService" as Algo
participant "Plugin\nRegistry" as Registry
participant "Lab\nOperator" as Lab

== Initialization ==
User -> UI: Submit research goal
UI -> API: POST /workflows/create
API -> Planner: Plan request

== Planning Phase ==
Planner -> Registry: Get available algorithms
Registry --> Planner: Algorithm manifests
Planner -> Planner: Decompose goal into tasks
Planner -> Executor: Task execution plan

== Execution Phase ==
Executor -> Temporal: Start workflow
activate Temporal

loop For each task
    Temporal -> Registry: Lookup algorithm
    Registry --> Temporal: Algorithm endpoint
    
    Temporal -> Algo: Execute task (gRPC)
    activate Algo
    Algo -> Algo: Process inputs
    Algo --> Temporal: Task result
    deactivate Algo
    
    Temporal -> Executor: Task completed
    Executor -> Critic: Evaluate result
    
    alt Result needs improvement
        Critic -> Planner: Request refinement
        Planner -> Executor: Updated plan
    else Result acceptable
        Critic -> Executor: Continue
    end
end

== Human-in-the-Loop ==
Lab -> Temporal: Signal experiment result
note right: Wet-lab validation
Temporal -> Temporal: Process signal
alt QC passed
    Temporal -> Temporal: Continue as new (v2)
else QC failed
    Temporal -> Executor: Compensate
end

== Completion ==
Temporal -> Executor: Workflow completed
deactivate Temporal
Executor -> API: Final results
API -> UI: Display results
UI -> User: Research complete
