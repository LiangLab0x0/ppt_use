# HelixCore Design Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. Composable by Contract

Every algorithm in HelixCore is a "contract-based" microservice that must declare its capabilities through a `manifest.yaml` file. This manifest serves as the single source of truth for:

- **Input/Output Schema**: Precise definition of data types and formats
- **Resource Requirements**: CPU, memory, GPU specifications
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning for compatibility tracking
- **Licensing**: Clear intellectual property boundaries

This approach ensures that algorithms can be:
- Discovered dynamically through the Plugin Registry
- Validated before deployment
- Composed into complex workflows without manual configuration
- Replaced or upgraded without breaking dependent services

### 2. Agents over Pipelines

Traditional workflow systems rely on rigid, predefined DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs). HelixCore takes a fundamentally different approach:

- **Dynamic Decision Making**: LLM-powered agents decide workflow paths at runtime
- **Adaptive Execution**: Workflows can change based on intermediate results
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Experimental results can modify ongoing workflows
- **Failure Resilience**: Agent failures don't lose workflow progress thanks to Temporal's durable execution

This philosophy acknowledges that R&D is inherently exploratory and unpredictable. Fixed pipelines cannot capture the iterative nature of scientific discovery.

### 3. Aesthetic Code = Reliable Code

We believe that beautiful, well-organized code is inherently more reliable and maintainable:

#### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Structure
```
domain/         # Pure business logic, no external dependencies
application/    # Use cases and orchestration
infrastructure/ # External integrations (DB, messaging, etc.)
interfaces/     # API contracts and user interfaces
```

#### Enforced Code Quality
- **Black**: Consistent formatting across the entire codebase
- **Ruff**: Fast, comprehensive linting with modern Python best practices
- **MyPy**: Static type checking for early error detection
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Quality gates before code enters the repository

Any pull request that fails linting is automatically blocked from merging. This isn't bureaucracy—it's a commitment to maintainability at scale.

### 4. Observability First

Every microservice in HelixCore ships with built-in observability:

#### Three Pillars of Observability
1. **Metrics**: Prometheus-compatible metrics for performance monitoring
2. **Traces**: Distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry for request flow analysis
3. **Logs**: Structured logging with correlation IDs for debugging

#### OTLP Export by Default
All telemetry data is exported using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), ensuring:
- Vendor neutrality
- Future-proof instrumentation
- Unified observability pipeline

This isn't an afterthought—it's designed into every service from day one.

## Architectural Decisions

### Why Temporal for Workflows?

Temporal provides unique capabilities essential for R&D workflows:

1. **Durable Execution**: Workflow state persists across failures, restarts, and updates
2. **Time Travel Debugging**: Replay any workflow execution for troubleshooting
3. **Version Management**: Deploy new workflow logic without losing in-flight executions
4. **Built-in Retry Logic**: Sophisticated retry policies with exponential backoff

### Why Multi-Agent Architecture?

Research workflows require intelligence, not just orchestration:

1. **Goal Decomposition**: Break high-level objectives into executable tasks
2. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjust plans based on results and constraints
3. **Collaborative Reasoning**: Multiple agents can debate and refine approaches
4. **Explainability**: Agents can explain their decisions for audit trails

### Why gRPC for Service Communication?

gRPC offers advantages over REST for microservice communication:

1. **Strong Typing**: Protocol buffers ensure type safety across services
2. **Performance**: Binary protocol with HTTP/2 multiplexing
3. **Code Generation**: Client/server stubs generated automatically
4. **Streaming Support**: Bidirectional streaming for real-time data

## Design Patterns

### Plugin Registration Pattern

Services self-register on startup:
```python
1. Load manifest.yaml
2. Validate against schema
3. Register with Plugin Registry
4. Start health check endpoint
5. Begin accepting requests
```

### Compensation Pattern

Every algorithm implements compensation logic:
```python
1. Execute forward operation
2. If failure occurs downstream:
   - Execute compensation in reverse order
   - Restore system to consistent state
   - Report compensation status
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

Protect against cascading failures:
```python
1. Track service health metrics
2. Open circuit on repeated failures
3. Provide fallback responses
4. Periodically test for recovery
```

## Future Considerations

### Extensibility Points

The architecture provides clear extension points:

1. **New Algorithm Types**: Implement `BaseAlgorithmService`
2. **Alternative Agents**: Swap AutoGen for LangGraph or custom implementations
3. **Storage Backends**: Replace PostgreSQL with other databases
4. **Workflow Engines**: Abstract Temporal behind interfaces

### Scaling Strategies

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless services scale with Kubernetes HPA
2. **Data Partitioning**: Shard by experiment ID or research domain
3. **Caching Layers**: Redis for frequently accessed algorithm results
4. **Edge Deployment**: Run algorithms close to lab equipment

### Security Considerations

1. **Zero Trust**: Mutual TLS between all services
2. **Policy as Code**: OPA for fine-grained authorization
3. **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all operations
4. **Data Encryption**: At rest and in transit

## Conclusion

HelixCore's design philosophy prioritizes flexibility, reliability, and scientific rigor. By combining modern software engineering practices with an understanding of research workflows, we create a platform that accelerates discovery without sacrificing quality or reproducibility.
